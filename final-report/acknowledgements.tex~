Thanks to Dr. Richard Jensen, Dr. Joanne Walker and Professor Simon Cox for their valuable input in the formative stages of the project.

Furthermore, thanks to all Computer Science Department staff who have taught me over the last 4 years for their patience and being such an inspiration with their varied interests and opinions.

I would like to thank Cottage Labs LLP for introducing me to the Open Knowledge movement, as well as teaching me about most of the major technologies used in this project and agreeing to host a FundFind instance.

Thanks to the Open Knowledge Foundation for striking out and encouraging prototype projects, providing ample inspiration for FundFind.

I would like to thank Research Councils UK, a partnership of the seven UK Research Councils, for all the effort they have put into the Gateway to Research API, consolidating data from seven separate institutions.
