\label{funding-blog-post}

Condense the contents of Chapter 1 - Audience and Chapter 2 - requirements list into 500 words.

Split per audience type: academic looking for funding, funder, analyst. What are the benefits of opening up the data for each one and why would each one \emph{want to share} such data - the whole project is useless without incentive, although the project itself helps in actually understanding what the incentive might be.

Also make initial list of features together with the new features from Chapter 2 into an unordered list of ideas of helpful functionality.
