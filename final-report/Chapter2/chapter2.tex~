\chapter{Development Process}

\section{Introduction}

%Introduce the specific model that you chose to use. 
% You need to describe briefly the life cycle model that you used. Do not force your project into the waterfall model if it is better described by prototyping or some other evolutionary model. You do not need to write about all of the different process models that you are aware of. Focus on the process model that you have used. It is possible that you needed to adapt an existing process model to suit your project; clearly identify what you used and how you adapted it for your needs.

\section{Modifications}
Did you have to modify the model to suit a one-person project. If so, what did you change and why? 

\section{Requirements}
% In most cases, the agreed objectives or requirements will be the result of a compromise between what would ideally have been produced and what was felt to be possible in the time available. A discussion of the process of arriving at the final list is usually appropriate.

% not everything described in audience could be done

\subsection{Requirements gathering}

% process - meetings etc.; any difficulties
% results - intermediary list

\subsection{Final requirements}
% why different from intermediary - what was discovered to be different / new etc. New info? Realised sth.? (Data better than features?)



% You should briefly describe the design method you used and any support tools that you used. You should discuss your choice of implementation tools - programming language, compilers, database management system, program development environment, etc.

\section{Design process}
% briefly describe the design method you used and any support tools that you used
% context and process implications on design

\section{Techologies used}
% context and process implications on implementation tools
% programming language, compilers
% database management system
% program development environment
% etc.
% frameworks
% always looking at other people's code, other FLOSS projects within OK movement
% bootstrapping the codebase from IDFind
% bootstrapping data gathering from bibserver
