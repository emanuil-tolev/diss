\chapter{Implementation}

% The implementation should look at any issues you encountered as you tried to implement your design. During the work, you might have found that elements of your design were unnecessary or overly complex, perhaps third party libraries were available that simplified some of the functions that you intended to implement. If things were easier in some areas, then how did you adapt your project to take account of your findings?

% It is more likely that things were more complex than you first thought. In particular, were there any problems or difficulties that you found during implementation that you had to address? Did such problems simply delay you or were they more significant? Your implementation might well be described in the same chapter as Problems (see below).

% working within context of other projects, have to keep conventions in mind, although better ways of doing things always welcome
