\end{center}

FundFind is a web application which enables scholars, research development officers and postgraduates to share information about funding opportunities. Data about funding opportunities and funding organisations can be submitted, browsed and searched via a mobile-friendly web UI as well as a JSON API. FundFind stores data using an asynchronous approach, which enables the development of small independent modules for automatic funding data harvesting.

The project is a learning excercise, aiming to explore the field of scholarly funding, identifying potential problems with the open sharing of such data. Prototype technical solutions concretise the technical problems. Other types of problems are noted and discussed.
