I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Reyer Zwiggelaar for his support and unique approach to the process of producing a major project.

Furthermore, thanks to all Computer Science Department staff who have taught me over the last 4 years for their patience and being such an inspiration with their varied interests and opinions.

I would like to thank Cottage Labs LLP for introducing me to the Open Knowledge movement, as well as teaching me about most of the major technologies used in this project and agreeing to host a FundFind instance.
