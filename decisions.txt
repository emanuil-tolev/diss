Initial scope of application
	accepting info about scifundopps (i.e. enable crowdsourcing)
	nice functional catalogue of these opps
	JSON + HTML representation of data made available by the app.
Potential expansions
	jnw thought it'd be useful for Research Dev. officers if they could store their searches and the opportunities they have found / forwarded on to their scientists. Would be nice if they could get out a report of what they've forwarded to scientists.
	app could subscribe itself to mailing lists of funding institutions, parse the digests and index the info
